Creating a Data Analysis Project based on Zomato chain supply to promote food in need in those cities.
Creating a Python script that loads the Zomato dataset, cleans it, and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights. 
<hr>
The script will cover:


<li>Loading and inspecting the dataset</li>
<li>Handling missing values</li>
<li>Data cleaning (renaming columns, removing duplicates)</li>
<li>Exploratory analysis (distribution of ratings, most popular cuisines, price range analysis, etc.)</li>
<br>



I've improved the accuracy of the analysis by:

<li>Converting relevant columns to numeric types.</li>
<li>Filtering out zero ratings to avoid misleading insights.</li>
<li>Extracting only the primary cuisine from the list.</li>
<li>Adding a correlation heatmap to analyze relationships.</li>
