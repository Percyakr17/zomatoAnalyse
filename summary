The zomatoAnalyis Python script performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to extract valuable insights. Below is a breakdown of its key steps:

Data Loading and Inspection

The script loads the Zomato dataset using Pandas.
It prints dataset information and the first few rows to understand the structure.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handles missing values by removing incomplete rows.
Standardizes column names by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.
Removes duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
Converts relevant columns (aggregate_rating and price_range) to numeric types for accurate analysis.
Filters out rows where the rating is zero to avoid skewed results.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations

Rating Distribution: A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of aggregate ratings.
Most Popular Cuisines: Extracts the first cuisine type and displays the top 10 most frequent ones using a bar chart.
Price Range Analysis:
A count plot shows how restaurants are distributed across different price ranges.
A box plot compares aggregate ratings across different price ranges.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays the relationship between price range and aggregate ratings.
Final Output

The script prints the final message indicating the completion of the analysis.
Several plots are generated to provide insights into restaurant ratings, cuisine popularity, and pricing trends.
